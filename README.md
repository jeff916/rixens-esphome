ESPHome YAML for Rixen's **MCS7** Hydronic Heating System

## Notes
This [ESPHome](https://esphome.io) YAML is written for an esp32 and uses the [esp32_can CAN Bus platform](https://esphome.io/components/canbus.html#esp32-can-component).

This is written and tested for the [Rixen's MCS7 hardware](https://rixens.com/collections/mcs-7-hydronic-system-documents). The CAN interface is pointed out on page 10 of the Rixen's [manual](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0530/5362/0413/files/Rixen_s_Installation_Manual_-_NA_10.2023_-_Final.pdf?v=1697649451).
